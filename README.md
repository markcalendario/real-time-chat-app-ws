# Real Time Chat App 

It is a simple web-based real time chat application built in MERN Stack and built-in Websocket.


## Lessons Learned

Websockets are used to build real time applications. However, the cons of using HTML websockets are it can't emit custom events to the server. The Socket.io, on the other hand, allows developers to create custom events.
